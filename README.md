"""
Project Scope:
This project is made primarily using discord.py and the football-data API for the purpose of allowing users to receive quick updates of upcoming matches, standings, and player stats of the Premier League. PitchPal uses replit and its database resource to store the favorite teams of users. 

Relevant Technologies:
PitchPal uses Python, Discord.py, the Football-Data API, Replit, Replit Databases, Flask, and various Python libraries for data management and organization.

Limitations:
Pitchpal currently only supports Premier League content, with intentions of adding functionality for other leagues. Additionally, functionality is being added to use each user's favorite teams to provide live updates of matches through the bot. 

NOTE:
This project will only run if used on Replit's IDE as it requires use of Replit's database feature.
